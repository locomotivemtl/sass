Sassy Mixins
============

A collection of pure Sass mixins and functions. Little to no configuration required.

### Requirements

Sass 3.3+

### What's in there?

Functions:

* **`span($span)`**: Returns a percentage number from `$span`, be it an explicit numerator (e.g., 1/3), a decimal (e.g., 0.3), or a spoken-word (e.g., 1 of 3).

Mixins:

* **`span($span, $property: width)`**: Set percentage number on property, usually to establish a column-width.
